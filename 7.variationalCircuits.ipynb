    "Current and near-term quantum computers suffer from imperfections, as we repeatedly pointed it out. This is why we cannot run long algorithms, that is, deep circuits on them. A new breed of algorithms started to appear since 2013 that focus on getting an advantage from imperfect quantum computers. The basic idea is extremely simple: run a short sequence of gates where some gates are parametrized. Then read out the result, make adjustments to the parameters on a classical computer, and repeat the calculation with the new parameters on the quantum hardware. This way we create an iterative loop between the quantum and the classical processing units, creating classical-quantum hybrid algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is shallow-circuit variational algorithm for gate-model quantum computers that was inspired by quantum annealing. We discretize the adiabatic pathway in some $p$ steps, where $p$ influences precision. Each discrete time step $i$ has two parameters, $\\beta_i, \\gamma_i$. **The classical variational algorithms does an optimization over these parameters (gradient descent for example...) based on the observed energy at the end of a run on the quantum hardware**.  ``The idea is to learn`` $\\beta_i, \\gamma_i$ ``in order to find the optimal shortcut through the adiabatic process in terms of a finite number of unitary operations (to be calculated on a quantum computer``.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, we want to discretize the time-dependent $H(t)=(1-t)H_0 + tH_1$ under adiabatic conditions. We achieve this by ``trotterizing`` the unitary; \"Trotterization\" = approximating a continuous Hamiltonian by the product of a large number of small discrete rotations, on 1 or 2 qubits at a time). The converse direction, proved by Aharonov et al. in 2004, is much more interesting: any quantum circuit can be simulated in the adiabatic model with only polynomial slowdown, provided youâ€™re willing to allow a final Hamiltonian whose ground state is a superposition over the entire history of the circuit-model computation.\n",

    "$$U(t_0) \\approx U(H_0, \\beta_0)U(H_1, \\gamma_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the idea is to start by applying the first Hamiltonian $H_0$ for some duration $\\beta_0$ followed by applying the second Hamiltonian $H_1$ for some time duration $\\gamma_0$.

The simplest mixing Hamiltonian is $H_0 = -\\sum_i \\sigma^X_i$, the same as the initial Hamiltonian in quantum annealing. By alternating between the two Hamiltonians, the mixing Hamiltonian drives the state towards and equal superposition, whereas the cost Hamiltonian tries to seek its own ground state.\n",

We can achieve the same effect the following way (this time using the Pauli-X operator):\n",

Each parameter is a binary vector of dimension `n_qubits`, such that the component $i$ is 1 if you want a Pauli matrix to apply on the $i^{th}$ qubit and 0 otherwise. For instance, $\\sigma_1^Z \\otimes \\sigma_3^Z \\otimes \\sigma_1^X$ would be implemented using `Pauli([1, 0, 1],[1, 0, 0])`.\n",
